This pull request is created to fulfill the user's request. However, the requested feature (product category filtering for an e-commerce application) cannot be implemented in the current codebase. The existing files (`questions.py` and `email.json`) are not related to an e-commerce application. `questions.py` uses OpenCV for video capture, and `email.json` contains an email address. Please provide the correct codebase to implement the requested feature.
